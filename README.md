# Network Scanning Script

This Bash script is designed to automate network scanning tasks using Nmap. It offers various scan types and options to suit different requirements.

## Usage

```bash
./network_scanner.sh <TARGET_IP> <SCAN_TYPE>
```

### Parameters:

- `<TARGET_IP>`: The IP address of the target system or network to scan.
- `<SCAN_TYPE>`: The type of scan to perform. Available options are:
  - `Quick`: Shows all open ports quickly (~15 seconds).
  - `Basic`: Runs a quick scan, then performs a more thorough scan on found ports (~5 minutes).
  - `UDP`: Performs a scan on UDP ports (~5 minutes).
  - `Full`: Runs a full range port scan, then performs a thorough scan on new ports (~5-10 minutes).
  - `Vulns`: Runs a CVE scan and Nmap Vulns scan on all found ports (~5-15 minutes).
  - `Recon`: Suggests recon commands and prompts to automatically run them.
  - `All`: Runs all the scans (~20-30 minutes).

### Examples:

```bash
# Perform a quick scan on a target IP
./network_scanner.sh 192.168.1.100 Quick

# Perform a full scan on a target IP
./network_scanner.sh 192.168.1.100 Full
```

## Requirements

- Bash shell
- Nmap tool installed (`sudo apt install nmap` on Debian-based systems)

## Notes

- Ensure that the script has executable permissions (`chmod +x network_scanner.sh`).
- Some scan types may take longer to complete depending on network conditions and target specifications.
- The script may require sudo/root privileges to run certain scan types or access certain features.
